        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> <span class="hl">Young adults</span> are a vast minority when it comes to voting in the election, and our goal is to try our best to change that from reoccurring in the next and upcoming elections. Young voters account for nearly half of the voting population but yet are much less likely to vote than older people. Young adults are a remarkably diverse group of people, considering this they could really sway the election in any other way. It’s really important to educate young people about politics since they are just learning about how it is to live on their own and make their own choices. Even if politics doesn’t feel relevant to you right now, it will in a few years. And that is why it is important to educate yourself in time for you to vote because you can decide who is going to rule your country. Nowadays it is extremely easy to educate yourself about politics and the different parties since you can find all the information you need on the internet.</p>
