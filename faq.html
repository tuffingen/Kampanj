        <li><p>Why is it important for young adults to vote?</p></li>
        <li><p class="answ">Because they are such a large part of the population and they are very important for society. It is best for them to get into a society where they feel comfortable. </p></li>
        <li><p>How can I educate myself on different political parties and their views?</p></li>
        <li><p class= "answ">In this day of age, it is extremely simple to be well educated on politics considering that everything you need to know is already out there on the internet for you to read. You can always visit the different parties’ own websites and learn about their standpoints on different topics.</p></li>
        <li><p>What can I gain from voting?</p></li>
        <li><p class= "answ">Even if you can’t see why it would make an impact on you now it most definitely will in the coming four years of your life. Remember that every vote matters and even if the party you voted for doesn’t win, you still used your privilege and opportunity to vote</p>
